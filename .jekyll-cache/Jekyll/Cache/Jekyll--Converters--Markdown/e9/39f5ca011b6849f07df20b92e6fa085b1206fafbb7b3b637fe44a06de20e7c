I"Ó<p>Road slopes are an important factor to consider when estimating trip costs and durations. GPS applications sometimes show altitude graphs along itinerary, and consider elevation in trip calculations. Android application <a href="https://osmand.net/">OSMAnd</a> is one example. In this post I will share one method I have used to fetch road slope data from a digital elevation model (DEM). From the data I could make a slope-along-road graph such as on OSMAnd.</p>
