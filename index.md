I am Privatemajory, a geographer who makes maps and data visualizations. To see some of my stuff, head over to my [gallery](/gallery) or read some of my [blog posts](/blog). Feel free to get in touch with me with one of the contact options at the bottom of this page. I'd make [beautiful maps](/gallery) for nothing!
